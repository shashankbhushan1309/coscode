You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps.
In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n <= 2) return n;
    
    int prev1 = 2; // ways to reach step 2
    int prev2 = 1; // ways to reach step 1
    int current;

    for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
        current = prev1 + prev2;
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = current;
    }

    return current;
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    cout << "Number of ways to climb " << n << " stairs: " << climbStairs(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
